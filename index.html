  <h1>Day1 Journal entry</h1>
 <p>I was extremely nervous the night before and very nervous the morning of. The staff quicly helped ease my nerves. I know this will ber a very difficult 13 weeks but I am feeling much better about it. I know I will need to give my best effort on a daily basis and work to not compare myself to others. </p>
